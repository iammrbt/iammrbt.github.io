# Hello and thanks for stopping by!

## I am Mr. BT,

I'm an Application Support Manager based in Chesapeake, VA—juggling IT support, software automation, and the occasional high-flying drone adventure. When I'm not streamlining business processes or championing ITIL best practices, I'm knee-deep in Python scripts and wrangling automation with Zapier and Power Automate. Yep, I wear my superhero Python/SQL cape both on and off the clock.

> I deliver top-notch ITSM for colleagues and clients around the globe, slicing through inefficiencies with a dash of irreverence.  
> I’m passionate about perfecting business processes and transforming routine 8-5s into opportunities for innovation.  
> My mission? Empower support teams with robust ITIL practices to ensure seamless, multi-tiered operations across the board.

## Beyond the Daily Hustle

When the workday ends, the adventure begins. Whether I'm piloting my drone over Chesapeake skies or conquering epic quests in the gaming world, I make sure my off-hours are as dynamic as my professional life.
