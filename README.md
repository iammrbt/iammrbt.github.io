## I am Mr. BT,
This is just a tiny about me page, references and resumes will be provided upon request :wink: :
> Providing excellent ITSM for both colleagues and clients reaching across the globe.
> I'm passionate about what I do and perfecting business processes to the best of my ability.
> Saving organizations time and money by delivering creative and powerful solutions is the regular 8-5 for me, while wearing my superhero Python/SQL cape both on and off the clock!
> I love to empower support teams with the ITIL best practices and ensure that standardization hits across all levels of a multi-team, multi-tear support model!
